# Python_HUB_Courses

Project purpose and relevance:

We have developed an e-commerce courses website so that the user can have access to various courses and study them. 

“AITU HUB” is our project that was created using the capabilities of the integrated development environment and design skills.

The web application uses a database and algorithms to work with users. 

Our project aims to ensure that students use the capabilities of our application for study, leisure, and development prospects.

The program is aimed at improving the learning environment and providing quality education to students.

Finding the necessary courses takes a lot of time, which complicates the student's learning process, an e-commerce website can solve this problem. 

The user can view the courses, add them to the cart and make a purchase.
